description: Main skill for building a new Android design system in Figma from scratch (Scenario A), from existing Android UI (Scenario B) or for an AI-ready refactor (Scenario C), or for Code to Design from a coded app into an existing or a new DS (Scenario D). Defines the file structure, build order, Material Design 3 token architecture (tonal palettes, md.sys.color schemes, state layers, md.sys.typescale, md.sys.shape, elevation levels, window size classes), Material Symbols icon rules, required components and states, and the mistakes to avoid - learned from studying the default Android reference design system (`references.json`). Independent from the Web and iOS skills. Load with figma-use and figma-generate-library before creating anything; save the project's skills under [Root]\My Projects\[Project]_Android\.

# Android Design System Builder (Main Skill)

Reference implementation studied: the platform's default entry in `references.json` (`default.android`; its folder, Figma link and name are there; human list in `References.md`). Other companies' Android systems can be added as entries; when the project picked one (`status.json > reference`), use that entry's folder instead. Today the default is the only Android entry, and section 9 below was learned from it.
It is the Google Material 3 (Expressive) Design Kit re-themed with the company's own palettes. Copy its **structure, M3 component coverage and property conventions**. Do **not** copy its mistakes (section 9).
Platform: Android, Material Design 3 Expressive, Jetpack Compose, dp / sp.
Node IDs quoted in a reference entry's skills are valid in that entry's original file only. In a duplicated template or any other file, find pages, component sets, styles and variables by **name**.

**Questions.** Every question with options in this skill (component scope, approvals, publish and Accept updates confirmations, recolor or token proposals) is an AskUserQuestion choice (`Ask (choice)` / `Ask (multi)`, Intake section 0); typed answers go in its Other field. Every menu also gets a "Back" option to the previous question or step (Intake section 0, Back on every menu).

**Tools and generic skills (figma-console).** The Figma tool (Desktop Bridge or FigCli) is picked in Intake section 0b (`status.json > figma.tool`), which also says when to suggest the other one. Work runs through figma-console `figma_execute` (plain Plugin API) when the official `use_figma` server is not connected. figma-use and figma-generate-library are still loaded for their rules, but their helper APIs (`figma.createAutoLayout`, `node.set`, `node.query`) do not exist in figma-console and fail with "not a function": use `figma.createFrame()` + `layoutMode`, `appendChild`, `setBoundVariable` directly. Call `resize()` before setting auto layout sizing to AUTO/HUG (resize resets it to FIXED), and re-apply `componentPropertyReferences` after cloning a variant. The reference page layout (section 1) and the intake checkpoints (Design_System_Intake_Skill section 8) override figma-generate-library's page skeleton and its per-phase checklist posts.

**Knowledge base (JSON, source of truth for exact values):** every DS folder has `data/tokens.json` (variables per mode, aliases, shade-scale curves, recolor readiness), `data/component-registry.json` (components, variants, properties, tiers), `data/rules.json` (numeric rules: contrast, touch targets, icon sizes, spacing, recolor) and `data/screen-templates.json` (Login, Sign up, OTP, List, Detail, Form, Settings, Empty state), plus `docs/decisions.md`. Read values from these files instead of copying numbers into skills; the reference versions are in the default Android entry's `data/` (`references.json`, today `Reference_Library/Trianglz/Android/data/`). Tools: `tools/build_tokens.py`, `tools/recolor.py` (see `tools/README.md`).

## 0. Both + Native projects (Abdul, 2026-09-30)

When intake 1.3 answers **Native** for Both, this skill builds only the Android half: `<Project> Android Design System` in `My Projects/<Project>_Android/`, with `md.sys.color` roles, the M3 type scale, state layers, elevation levels, Material Symbols and dp/sp units. The iOS half is a separate system built with `iOS_Design_System_Skill` in `<Project>_iOS/`; never reuse its names, files or components.
- Optional Brand Foundation (`<Project> Brand Foundation`, Primitives only): copy its Primitives into this file's local tonal palettes / Primitives collection (same values), never enable it as a library. A brand change goes into the Brand Foundation first, then `tools/recolor.py` on this folder.
- The Android Design file (`<Project> Android`) enables only the Android DS library. The file check rejects the iOS library in it.
- `status.json`: `mobile_setup: native`, `sibling_project: My Projects/<Project>_iOS/`, `figma.brand_foundation` when used.
- Mobile Adaptive (Native, one file; intake 1.3, `mobile_setup: mobile-adaptive`): this skill is the platform reference for the OS-mode values in a shared iOS + Android file; build rules in `Design_System_Intake_Skill/steps/mobile-adaptive.md`.
- **Cross-platform** (Flutter / React Native, one shared design): one DS and one Design file in `<Project>_Mobile/`; this skill is the base when intake 1.5 chose Material 3 or a custom brand UI.

## 1. File structure (pages, in this order)

```

⭐Setup
➜ Color                  (tonal palettes + scheme Light/Dark (+ contrast) swatches, all bound)

```
Keep research boards out of the DS file (the reference has a 12800px ➜ Research page in Setup). XR variants go in their own `... for XR` sections.

### Group routing rule
| Request is about... | Goes under | Android examples |
|---|---|---|
| Tokens, type, shape, elevation, state layers, grids, icons, utilities | **⭐Setup** | new scheme role, typescale change, window class grid |
| Anything the user **enters or chooses data** with | **⭐Form Elements** | text field, dropdown, checkbox, radio, switch, slider, search, pickers |
| Any **action** or **movement between destinations** | **⭐Navigation** | buttons, FAB, app bar, nav bar/rail, toolbar, tabs, menus |
| Anything that **displays information** | **⭐Data display** | cards, lists, chips, badges, dialogs, sheets, snackbar, tooltip, carousel, progress |

Page convention (from the kit): one Section per family with `Header`, the public set(s), a `Building Blocks` frame for private parts (`.Building Blocks/...`), `Note` sections, and **Light + Dark preview frames** of instances (missing in the reference - add them).

## 2. Build order (each layer only uses the layers before it)
1. **Primitives** = tonal palettes (tones 0, 4, 6, 10, 12, 17, 20, 22, 24, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 87, 90, 92, 94, 95, 96, 98, 99, 100) per key color, generated with Material Color Utilities (HCT) from the brand seeds. 1 mode.
2. **Semantic** = md.sys.color scheme roles aliased to palette tones, modes **Light / Dark** (+ **Light Medium/High Contrast**, **Dark Medium/High Contrast** when required); **state layers** as aliases + opacity variables.
3. **Spacing, Shape, Typography** variables (md.sys.typescale: font, size, line height, tracking, weight per role/size).
4. **Styles**: text styles bound to the typescale variables; **Elevation 1-5** effect styles; grid styles per window size class.
5. **Icons** (Material Symbols, atoms), then components **Atoms -> Molecules -> Organisms -> Patterns**.
6. **Documentation pages** linked. 7. **Audit** + write the project skills.
Before each component: state tier, list dependencies, build lower tiers first, post the atomic structure map.

## 3. Token architecture (md.sys naming)

### Palettes (primitives, 1 mode, no scopes, hidden)
`palette/{primary, secondary, tertiary, error, neutral, neutral-variant}/{tone}` + custom `palette/{success, warning, info}/{tone}`. Generate with HCT so tone = perceptual lightness (the reference hand-picked tones: uneven steps).

### Schemes (modes Light / Dark / contrast) - `md.sys.color` roles, Figma path `Schemes/<Group>/<Role>`
| Role family | Light tone | Dark tone |
|---|---|---|
| primary / on-primary / primary-container / on-primary-container | 40 / 100 / 90 / 10 (30 in Expressive light) | 80 / 20 / 30 / 90 |
| secondary..., tertiary..., error... | same pattern | same |
| custom success / warning / info (+ containers) | same pattern | same |
| surface / surface-dim / surface-bright | 98 / 87 / 98 (N) | 6 / 6 / 24 |
| surface-container-lowest / low / (default) / high / highest | 100 / 96 / 94 / 92 / 90 | 4 / 10 / 12 / 17 / 22 |
| on-surface / on-surface-variant | N10 / NV30 | N90 / NV80 |
| outline / outline-variant | NV50 / NV80 | NV60 / NV30 |
| inverse-surface / inverse-on-surface / inverse-primary | N20 / N95 / P80 | N90 / N20 / P40 |
| primary-fixed / -fixed-dim / on-primary-fixed / on-primary-fixed-variant (and secondary, tertiary) | 90 / 80 / 10 / 30 | same |
| shadow, scrim | N0 | N0 |
- Scopes per role (TEXT_FILL for on-*, FRAME/SHAPE_FILL for containers/surfaces, STROKE for outline) - **never ALL_SCOPES**.
- Code syntax **Android** on every variable: `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary` (Compose) / `?attr/colorPrimary`; description with the md.sys token name.
- Drop deprecated roles (background, surface-variant) or mark them deprecated.

### State layers
- Opacity variables `state/hover 0.08`, `state/focus 0.10`, `state/pressed 0.10`, `state/dragged 0.16`, `state/disabled-container 0.12`, `state/disabled-content 0.38`.
- State layer color = the **content (on-) role alias** (e.g. `State Layers/On Primary` -> Schemes/On Primary) with the opacity applied on the layer, not raw RGBA copies (reference: 180 raw RGBA values, several stale).

### Typography (md.sys.typescale) - 1 mode (add a Large-screen mode only if needed)
`typescale/{display,headline,title,label,body}-{large,medium,small}/{size, line-height, tracking, weight}` + `font/{brand, plain}`.
M3 values: display 57/64 -0.25, 45/52, 36/44 · headline 32/40, 28/36, 24/32 · title 22/28, 16/24 +0.15, 14/20 +0.1 · label 14/20 +0.1, 12/16 +0.5, 11/16 +0.5 · body 16/24 +0.5, 14/20 +0.25, 12/16 +0.4. Emphasized variants (Expressive) use a heavier weight (Medium 500 / Bold for display).
Font: Roboto Flex by default, or the brand font (the reference uses Google Sans Flex - confirm licensing).

### Shape (md.sys.shape.corner) - `Corner/{None 0, Extra-small 4, Small 8, Medium 12, Large 16, Large-increased 20, Extra-large 28, Extra-large-increased 32, Extra-extra-large 48, Full}`, CORNER_RADIUS scope, usage descriptions (text field top XS, chip S, card M, FAB L, dialog/sheet XL, button Full).
### Spacing (dp) - `space/{0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64}` + `space/margin-compact 16`, `space/margin-medium 24`, `space/gutter`. Scopes GAP + WIDTH_HEIGHT. (Missing entirely in the reference.)
### Elevation - `elevation/level-{0..5}` = 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 12 dp (documented), effect styles Elevation 1-5.

## 3b. Recolor-ready colors (Abdul's rule: a color change must update every shade cleanly)

Build rules (every new DS):
- Primitives hold the only raw colors. Each hue is a full shade scale with fixed step names (M3 tones 0 ... 100); a brand color is a ramp, never a single swatch.
- Generate each ramp from one base color with a stored curve (M3 tonal palette: HCT / tone = L*; key color at tone 40), not by hand-picking steps. Record the base and the curve in `data/tokens.json > ramps` (run `python tools/build_tokens.py <folder>` after exporting variables).
- Semantic (and Brand) tokens **only alias** Primitives. Zero raw hex outside Primitives; `tokens.json > recolor_readiness.ready` must be `true`.
- Components use Semantic tokens only, never Primitives directly and never raw colors.
- Colors that need alpha (scrims, state layers, tints) use alpha Primitives, or are listed as **derived tokens** in `data/rules.json > recolor.derived_tokens` so the recolor script regenerates them.
- Never rename a Primitive during a recolor: names are the contract that keeps every alias linked.

Recolor procedure (when the user asks to change a color):
1. Find the ramp in `data/tokens.json > ramps` and which Semantic tokens alias it.
2. Run `python tools/recolor.py <folder> --ramp "<ramp>" --base "#hex"`. It regenerates every step with the ramp's curve, recomputes derived tokens, and re-checks every contrast pair in `data/rules.json` in Light and Dark (pairs that were already failing are reported separately).
3. Fix any NEW contrast failure by re-pointing that Semantic alias to another step (never a raw hex), then run the script again.
4. Apply the generated `data/recolor/<date>-<ramp>.figma.js` with figma_execute: it sets values into the SAME variables by name and never creates, renames or deletes.
5. Re-export variables and run `tools/build_tokens.py` (or re-run recolor with `--write-tokens`) so `tokens.json` matches Figma.
6. Screenshot ➜ Colors and every component page in Light and Dark; compare with the previous screenshots.
7. Log it in `docs/decisions.md`.

**Fix on create:** when a DS starts from an existing file or a reference template, run `tools/fix_tokens.py` and apply its plan before building anything (Design_System_Intake_Skill section 7b). New builds run it as the last foundation step; its plan must come back empty.

## 4. Styles
- **Text styles** `{role}/{size}` and `{role}/{size}-emphasized` (30), all properties bound to **local** typescale variables. Description `16sp / 24sp / 400 / +0.5 · MaterialTheme.typography.bodyLarge`.
- **Effect styles** `Elevation/1..5` (key + ambient shadows; one set - Light and Dark are identical in M3), colors bound to `Schemes/Shadow` if export allows.
- **Grid styles** per window size class: Compact 0-599 (4 col, 16 margin, 16 gutter), Medium 600-839 (8, 24-32, 16-24), Expanded 840-1199 (12, 24, 24), Large 1200-1599, Extra-large 1600+ (+ layout region variants).
- No color styles (utility paint styles only if needed).

## 5. Icons
- Material Symbols (Rounded or Outlined - pick one), weight 400, grade 0, optical size 24; names snake_case as in Google Fonts (`arrow_back`, `more_vert`), filled versions with `_filled` suffix (never two components with the same name).
- 24dp default (18 chips, 20 small buttons, 36 large FAB), single vector bound to `Schemes/On Surface` and recolored per component with on-roles.
- Exposed as INSTANCE_SWAP `Icon` / `Icon (selected)` with `Show icon` booleans (M3 kit convention). Components use the **local** icon set only (reference uses remote kit icons).

## 6. Component conventions (M3 kit)
- Public names match M3 (`Button`, `Button - tonal`, `Icon button - outline`, `Navigation Rail`); private parts start with `.Building Blocks/` and live in the Building Blocks frame.
- Properties: `State` = Enabled, Hovered, Focused, Pressed, (Dragged), Disabled · `Selected` · `Size` XSmall, Small, Medium, Large, XLarge · `Type`/`Style`/`Color`/`Configuration` · BOOLEAN `Show ...` and `Show focus indicator` · TEXT `Label text`, `Supporting text`, `Headline` · INSTANCE_SWAP `Icon`, `Icon (selected)` · SLOT `Content`.
- Anatomy: container > `State-layer` frame (state overlay) > content; ripple only in Pressed; focus indicator 3dp outline offset (Utilities).
- 100% bound: fills, strokes, **padding/gap (spacing)**, **radius (Shape)**, text styles, effect styles; 0 remote variables/styles/components.
- Touch target 48x48dp (visual 40dp controls inside 48 targets).
- Disabled per M3 recipe: container on-surface 12%, content on-surface 38%.
- Descriptions on every set (M3 kit text is fine) + when to use / not use.

### Required inventory and states (Android)
| Tier | Component | Variants / states |
|---|---|---|
| Atom | Button (filled, tonal, outlined, elevated, text) | XSmall-XLarge · Round/Square · icon optional · Enabled, Hovered, Focused, Pressed, Disabled |
| Atom | Toggle button, Icon button (standard, filled, tonal, outlined; togglable) | + Selected · Width Narrow/Default/Wide |
| Atom | FAB, Extended FAB | Default/Medium/Large · 6 colors · Enabled, Hovered, Focused, Pressed |
| Atom | Checkbox (incl. error), Radio, Switch (icon optional) | Selected x 5 states |
| Atom | Chips (assist, filter, input, suggestion), Badge (small/large), Avatar, Divider, Nav item, Tab item, Menu item, Progress / Loading indicator | M3 states |
| Molecule | Text field (filled/outlined, leading/trailing icon, supporting text, error, prefix/suffix, counter), Exposed dropdown, Search bar, Button groups (standard/connected), Split button, List item, Snackbar, Tooltips, Slider | |
| Organism | App bar (small, center, medium, large, search), Navigation bar / rail / expanded rail, Toolbar (docked/floating), Tabs, Menu, Dialog (basic, list, full-screen), Bottom / side sheet, Card (elevated, filled, outlined), Date/time pickers, Carousel, FAB menu | |
| Pattern | Screens per window size class (compact list-detail, expanded two-pane), sign-in, OTP, settings | |

## 7. Theming and adaptivity
- Dark mode = `m3` Dark mode on the frame; contrast modes as extra modes; dynamic color (Material You) documented as a runtime option.
- **Single-mode systems** (intake 0.4 = Light only or Dark only): the Semantic collection has one mode named after the answer (`Light` or `Dark`). Every "Light and Dark" requirement in this skill, the intake checkpoints, the audits, the docs pages and the Storybook quality bar means "each mode the project has": no second preview frame, one swatch frame per collection, screenshots in that mode only, contrast checked against that mode's surfaces only.
- Adaptive layout: Compact -> Navigation bar; Medium -> Navigation rail; Expanded+ -> Expanded rail / two panes; grids per window class.

## 8. Documentation pages (linked, never static)
- ➜ Color: palettes and schemes (Light and Dark) with every swatch bound (the reference does this well: ~97% bound).
- ➜ Typography: every specimen uses its local style; table values from variables.
- ➜ Shape: swatches bound to Shape variables (reference: unbound). ➜ Elevation: local styles, Dark frame on the local mode.

## 9. Mistakes found in the default Android reference - never repeat them
1. No spacing variables - every padding and gap raw.
2. Typography sizes/line heights bound to **remote** M3 kit `Static/*` variables; display/headline raw; tracking 0; sizes off the M3 scale.
3. ALL_SCOPES on palettes and schemes; no code syntax; almost no descriptions.
4. State layers as ~180 **raw RGBA** copies, several stale vs the brand scheme.
5. Components still using **remote M3 kit** icons, text styles (`M3/body/large`...), effect styles, scheme variables and nested components (Button - text, Icon button - standard, dividers).
6. Hand-picked tonal palettes (not HCT); Dark surface = pure black; surface container tiers off the M3 tones.
7. Deprecated roles left in (`Background (Deprecated)` with a remote Dark alias, `Surface Variant??`), typos (`Sucess Container`, `Presssed`, `Hovere`, `Time PIcker`, `Accordion buttton`), `Property 1` and an empty property name.
8. Shape collection underused - radii raw; FAB bound to a remote corner variable.
9. Duplicate icon names without `_filled`; no dark previews; baseline and expressive generations mixed without deprecation notes; research board inside the DS file.

## Screens (Design files)
- Screens are built only from the published DS library, section by section (figma-generate-design + figma-use + ui-ux-pro-max), at the sizes in Design_System_Intake_Skill section 7d.
- **Screen fidelity (Abdul's rule):** follow Design_System_Intake_Skill section 7f (`Design_System_Intake_Skill/steps/screens.md`): screen spec from every source image first, real content in every instance, one section per script, side-by-side check after each screen (run in ds-auditor), `tools/check_screens.figma.js`, checkpoint stays `Ready for review` until the user approves.
- **Multi-screen flows (Abdul's rule):** follow Design_System_Intake_Skill section 7e (`steps/screens.md`) in order: approved gap table, missing components in the DS file, publish + Accept updates + verify, screens one by one with a Design file audit after each, changelog + Storybook question.
- **Scenario C, imperfect DS + Design file (Abdul's rule):** follow Design_System_Intake_Skill section 7 (`steps/brownfield-3-scenario-c.md`) in order: Variable Map, DS fixes (safe ones as Fix on create, the rest after approval) + publish, screen-by-screen audit report, raw-value rules, fixes after approval, log + Accept updates. Android mapping: colors map to `md.sys.color` roles (section 3), text to `md.sys.typescale`, radius to `md.sys.shape.corner`, shadows to the elevation levels; raw overlay colors on pressed/hover map to state layers.
- **Scenario D, Code to Design (Abdul's rule, 2026-10-05):** follow Design_System_Intake_Skill section 6 (`steps/code-to-design.md`). The code (repo routes, popups, states, texts, icons) is the source of the screens; a live preview is a visual reference only. Branch a, existing DS: the DS is read only except the editable page the user names; reuse its components and variables first, map every code value to the nearest DS token, add only missing components on that page (lowest tier first), report DS issues instead of fixing them, ask before each publish, build screens in the linked Design file, keep the user's manual edits, audit after each step. Branch b, new DS: Primitives and Semantics from the code's tokens, then this skill's build order and components, then screens per module. Android mapping: `colors.xml`, `themes.xml`, `Color.kt` / `Theme.kt` / `Type.kt` (or a web codebase's CSS variables) map to tonal-palette Primitives and `md.sys.color` roles, text to `md.sys.typescale`, shapes to `md.sys.shape.corner`, shadows to the elevation levels, pressed / hover overlays to state layers, Material Symbols names to the Icon set.
- **Design file audit (Abdul's rule, every time screens are built or changed):** run audit-design-system (ds-auditor, `screens` mode) on that Design file to confirm it really uses the DS: library components only (no local copies, detached instances or hand-drawn parts), library variables and styles only (no raw values, no variables used for the wrong purpose), latest library version. Fix what it finds, save the report in `<Project folder>/audits/`, and log the result in `CHANGELOG.md` (`Design file audit: <numbers>, report <path>`).

## 10. Final QA checklist
- [ ] 0 remote variables, styles and components; 0 raw fills/strokes/padding/gap/radius/effects.
- [ ] Palettes HCT-generated; schemes follow M3 tones; contrast modes if required.
- [ ] Every variable: scope, Android code syntax, description (md.sys name). Every set: description, M3 property names, wired props.
- [ ] State layers = alias + opacity; disabled per M3 recipe; focus indicator on every interactive component.
- [ ] Typescale local and bound (size, line height, tracking, weight); Shape and Spacing bound everywhere.
- [ ] Icons local Material Symbols instances with swap properties.
- [ ] Targets >= 48dp; contrast text >= 4.5:1, UI >= 3:1 in each mode the project has.
- [ ] Light and Dark preview frames per family; Color/Typography/Shape docs linked.
- [ ] Screenshot every variant (light + dark) and compare with the description.
- [ ] Save a version after each phase; write Foundation_Skill and Component_Skills per group.
- [ ] `tokens.json > recolor_readiness.ready` is true (0 raw hex in Semantic/Brand tokens) and a test run of `tools/recolor.py` on the brand ramp shows no NEW contrast failures.
- [ ] `data/tokens.json`, `component-registry.json`, `rules.json`, `screen-templates.json` and `docs/decisions.md` are generated for the new DS.
- [ ] `python tools/fix_tokens.py <folder>` returns an empty plan (0 operations).
