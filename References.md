# References

## Reference library (duplicate, never edit the originals)

The workflow learns from studied design systems and can start a project from one of them. They are listed in `references.json` (Root): one entry per company and platform (`web`, `ios`, `android`, `cross-platform`), each with its folder of study skills, Figma link and optional Storybook. `default` picks the entry used per platform when the user does not choose. Skills, the intake and tools read `references.json`; they never name a company.

Current entries (from `references.json`):

| Entry | Platform | Figma file | Study folder |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trianglz - Web Design System | Web | https://www.figma.com/design/7qsOqckanKwGDbkljD3rb9/Trianglz---Web-Design-System | `Reference_Library/Trianglz/Web/` |
| Trianglz - IOS Design System | iOS | https://www.figma.com/design/q5nQHGEGzZ94WN0wilJwLW/Trianglz---IOS-Design-System | `Reference_Library/Trianglz/iOS/` |
| Trianglz - Android M3 x Design System | Android (M3) | https://www.figma.com/design/JUs2c8IO6ybFcGRZjcQzr9/Trianglz---Android-M3-x-Design-System | `Reference_Library/Trianglz/Android/` |
| Astryx Library DS | Web (second template, not default) | https://www.figma.com/design/kiygMAdfsXmLfxlP8i7ueN/Astryx-Library-DS | `Reference_Library/Astryx/Web/` |

How to start from a reference template:
1. Open the link and choose **Duplicate** (the copy lands in your drafts).
2. Move the copy to your project folder in Figma and rename it `<Project> Design System`.
3. Give the link to Claude in the intake (Greenfield > "Start from a reference template").

Rules:
- Each entry's skills describe what is in its file and list its known gaps (`references/gaps.md`). Fix those gaps in your copy.
- Node IDs written in a reference's skills belong to its original file only. A duplicate gets new IDs, so Claude finds everything by component, style and variable **name**.
- You need view access to the originals to duplicate them.

## Adding a design system to the library (`/study-reference-ds`)
Say "study this design system" with the company name, the platform(s) and the Figma link(s). One run per platform; a company with Web, iOS, Android and cross-platform files gets four entries, studied one per session (token budget). Nothing here touches the original Figma file: it is read only, and the guard hook asks before any write to it.
1. **Register and scaffold.** `python tools/add_reference.py --company "<Company>" --platform <web|ios|android|cross-platform> --name "<Figma file name>" --figma-url <link> [--default]`. It creates `Reference_Library/<Company>/<Platform>/` (Foundation_Skill, Component_Skills for Form Elements, Navigation and Data Display, `data/`, `docs/`), marks the original file key off-limits and adds the entry to `references.json` with `status: "studying"`.
2. **Open the file.** The user opens it in Figma Desktop with FigCli Yolo (`FIGMA_FILE` set to its exact name) or the Desktop Bridge; confirm the file key (or, when FigCli cannot read it, the exact name) matches the entry.
3. **Study the Setup group first:** page structure, variables (`token-extractor` -> `data/source/figma-variables.dtcg.json`, `data/source/config.json`, then `python tools/build_tokens.py <folder>`), text and effect styles, icons. Write `Foundation_Skill` (SKILL.md, references/variables.md, gaps.md).
4. **Study each component group** (⭐Form Elements, ⭐Navigation, ⭐Data Display): every component's purpose, variants, properties, states, nesting and tier, with Light and Dark screenshots of every variant (in `ds-auditor` / `docs-writer` so images stay out of the main session). Write each Component_Skill (SKILL.md, references/components.md, gaps.md) and `data/component-registry.json`, `data/rules.json`, `data/screen-templates.json`, `docs/decisions.md`.
5. **Compare with the platform Main Skill.** Mistakes the file makes go into its `gaps.md`; a lesson that applies to every project goes into the Main Skill (section 9 or 10) without the company name.
6. **Ready.** Set the entry's `status` to `"ready"` (and `default` if it should be the platform default), update `memory/references.md`, log it and commit.

What users see afterwards: Greenfield 3.1 offers "Start from a reference template"; when a platform has more than one ready entry, a menu lists them by `name` with the default first (Recommended). Entries still `studying` are never offered.

Rules: platforms stay independent (one entry per platform, nothing shared or merged between entries); a cross-platform entry (one shared design for Flutter / React Native custom UI) is offered when intake 1.3 picks cross-platform; never edit the original file.
