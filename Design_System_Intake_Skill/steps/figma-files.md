# Linked Figma files, publish and file check

Part of `Design_System_Intake_Skill` (sections keep their original numbers, so "section 7c" etc. still resolve; the map is in `SKILL.md` section 0c). Load before the first Figma work of every session (every path).

## 7c. Linked Figma files: registry, publish and file check (every path)

Each project has **one Design System file** and a **list of Design files** (screens), stored in `[Project folder]\status.json > figma`:
- `design_system`: name, url, file_key, last_publish, tool (`figcli` / `desktop-bridge`, the tool last used on this file; Intake section 0b). For FigCli (Yolo) the exact `name` is also the `FIGMA_FILE` value for that file, so keep it exactly as Figma shows it.
- `design_files`: one entry per file: name (e.g. Web App, Admin Dashboard, Marketing Site), url, file_key, role (`screens`, or `source` for Brownfield type 1 before the DS exists), content (`frames`, `screenshots`, `mixed`), library_updates_accepted (true / false), tool (as above).
- `brand_foundation` (Both + Native only, optional): name, url, file_key of `<Project> Brand Foundation`; the same entry is stored in the iOS and the Android folder. It is a value source only, never enabled as a library in a Design file.
- The file key is the part of the Figma URL after `/design/` or `/file/`. Ask for the links once (question 0.2); later sessions read them from `status.json`.
- `layout` (Scenario C, section 7g): `separate` (default, a DS library file plus Design files) or `single-file` (the DS lives inside the Design file: `design_system` and `design_files[0]` share one `file_key`, `ds_pages` lists the DS page names, and `library_updates_accepted` is `null`).

**Single-file projects (`layout` = `single-file`):** the publish steps below do not apply. After a DS change, ask Abdul to save a Figma version named after the step (Ask (choice): "Is the version saved?" "Done, saved" / "Not yet") and log `Version saved: <name>` in `CHANGELOG.md`. The file check runs once for both roles; DS work writes only on `ds_pages`, screen work only on the other pages, and step 4 (library enabled) is skipped.

**After any change to the DS file** (variables, styles, components):
1. Say "Please publish the '<DS name>' library (Assets > Library > Publish).", then Ask (choice): "Is it published?" "Done, published" / "Not yet".
2. When confirmed, set `design_system.last_publish` to today, set every design file's `library_updates_accepted` to false, and log it in `CHANGELOG.md` (`Library published: yes`).
3. List the linked Design files that still need the update, then Ask (multi): "Which files have you updated (Accept updates)?" one option per file name (more than 4: the 4 most used, the rest typed in Other). Set each ticked file to true and record it in the same changelog entry.

**Before any Figma work (the file check):**
1. Screen work with more than one Design file: Ask (choice): "Which Design file should I work on?" one option per registered Design file name (the last one worked on first).
2. Ask the user to open that file (or the DS file for DS work) in Figma Desktop and, for the Desktop Bridge, start its plugin (Intake section 0b), then Ask (choice): "Done, file open" / "Not yet". FigCli (Yolo) needs no plugin; Figma can stay minimized.
3. When connected, verify the file with the tool in use. It must be the file registered for this project and the role you need.
   - Desktop Bridge: read the file key (figma_get_status / figma_list_open_files) and compare it with `status.json`.
   - FigCli (Yolo): run `FIGMA_FILE="<name from status.json>" node src/index.js eval "figma.root.name + ' | ' + figma.fileKey"` and compare the name **exactly** (and the key when it is not undefined). Use the same `FIGMA_FILE` on every later command for that file; without it, commands go to the last connected file, not the one on screen. If another open file shares part of the name (an original and its copy), make `FIGMA_FILE` the full name or a part only the target has, and say so. On a mismatch, **write nothing**.
4. For screen work, also check that the DS library is enabled in that file and current (its library variables and components are visible, and `library_updates_accepted` is true after the last publish).
5. On any mismatch (a file from another project, an unregistered file, the DS file when screens were expected, the library missing or out of date, or in a Both + Native project an iOS Design file with the Android library enabled or the reverse): **stop, touch nothing**, and tell the user what is connected and what was expected.
6. **Mixed tools** (FigCli on one file, Desktop Bridge on another) are allowed. Cross-file steps (publish, Accept updates, the library check in step 4) need both connections up; check each one with its own tool before starting. With FigCli both files are reachable at once: switch with `FIGMA_FILE` per command and re-check `figma.root.name` before the first write after each switch.
7. **Two or more files connected** (e.g. the DS file and a Design file): the Desktop Bridge "active file" follows the user's focus, so node ids from one file get looked up in the other. Before any write or screenshot, pin the target with `figma_navigate` (`lock: true`) and re-pin after switching files.
8. **Screenshots and exports** (`exportAsync`, `figma_capture_screenshot`) also need the target file to be the **visible tab** in Figma Desktop; in a background tab they time out while structural reads still work. Before screen work, say once: "Please keep '<file name>' as the front tab in Figma until the Screens checkpoint." (Ask (choice): "Done" / "Not yet"). If a capture times out, ask the user to bring the file to the front, then retry.
