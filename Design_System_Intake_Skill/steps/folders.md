# Folder conventions

Part of `Design_System_Intake_Skill` (sections keep their original numbers, so "section 7c" etc. still resolve; the map is in `SKILL.md` section 0c). Load at question 0.3 (creating the project folder) or when unsure where a file goes. Every `Ask (choice)` / `Ask (multi)` here also gets a "Back" option (`SKILL.md` section 0, Back on every menu).

## 10. Folder conventions

- New project folders are copies of `My Projects\_Project_Template\`. Each can become its own private Git repo, separate from the workflow repo (see `My Projects\README.md`); never create or push one without asking.
- Root tools take the project folder relative to the Root, quoted: `python tools/build_tokens.py "My Projects/<Project>"`.
- One folder per platform: "Both" + Native creates `<Project>_iOS\` and `<Project>_Android\`, each with its own full skill set (and `<Project>_Brand\` with `Project_Brief.md`, `status.json` and `data\tokens.json` Primitives when the Brand Foundation is chosen). "Both" + Cross-platform creates one `<Project>_Mobile\`.
- Group routing for new components and pages (Figma and skills): foundations (including ➜ App Icon) -> ⭐Setup / Foundation_Skill; data entry -> ⭐Form Elements; actions and navigation -> ⭐Navigation; information display -> ⭐Data Display. Create a new `➜` page in the matching group when no page fits.
- Figma file names: `<Project> Design System` for the library, `<Project>` for screens. Both + Native: `<Project> iOS Design System`, `<Project> Android Design System`, `<Project> iOS`, `<Project> Android`, optional `<Project> Brand Foundation`. Page structure follows the platform Main Skill (Cover, ⭐Setup, ⭐ groups with ➜ topic pages).
