name: design-system-intake
description: Main entry skill for every use of "Design systems Ai Ready". Runs first, before any other skill or Figma call. Interviews the user one question at a time (in English) to collect the project basics, platform, and whether the work is Greenfield or Brownfield, then routes to the right path (new DS, screens without a DS, Code to Design from a coded app into an existing or a new DS (Scenario D), imperfect DS with a Design file that follows it partly or not at all, Scenario C), loads the matching platform Main Skill (Web_Design_System_Skill, iOS_Design_System_Skill, Android_Design_System_Skill), enforces the approval checkpoints (Foundation, Components, Screens) and always ends by writing the project skills and running the final audit.

# Design System Intake (Main Skill - runs first, every time)

Root: the folder that contains this skill's parent folder (the repo root, where `CLAUDE.md` lives). All paths below are relative to the Root.
This skill decides **what** to build and **which path** to follow. The platform Main Skills decide **how** to build it.
Never touch Figma while this intake is running. Figma work starts only after the path is chosen and the platform Main Skill plus its required skills are loaded.

---

## 0. Interview rules

- Ask **one question per message**, in English, and wait for the answer. Never send a list of questions at once.
- **The first reply asks about the project, never about Storybook.** The SessionStart notice (Storybook exists, projects with unsynced changes) is passed on as one informational line at most. Storybook questions come at 0.7 for a new project, or right after 0.0 when the user picks an existing project that has unsynced changelog entries or a `later` Storybook plan whose trigger was reached.
- Use the exact questions below and in `steps/*.md`, asked in the form of the next rule.
- **Choice questions use arrow-key options, everywhere in the workflow (Abdul, 2026-10-01).** Any question the user answers by picking (in this intake, every `steps/*.md` file, quick mode, the platform Main Skills, the Storybook skill, checkpoints and approvals, Scenario C decisions, publish and Accept updates confirmations, the session-start handoff and Storybook checks) is asked with Claude Code's **AskUserQuestion** tool, never as plain text. In the skills such a question is written `Ask (choice)` or `Ask (multi)`, with its options separated by ` / `; the first option is the recommended one unless another is marked.
  - **Options:** a label of 1-5 words each; the recommended option goes first with "(Recommended)" at the end of its label; the explanation (a tool's biggest advantage, what happens next) goes in the option's description, not the label; at most 4 options. With more (0.0 with many projects, a list of Design files), show the 3 most likely and let "Other" take the rest, or split the question.
  - **Other (free text):** AskUserQuestion always adds "Other", where the user can type. Never add an "Other" option yourself. Where typing is the likely answer, make it the documented path: say in the question that "Other" takes it (a font name at 0.6, a folder path at 0.3, a different industry at 3.4, the change to make on "Request changes").
  - **`Ask (multi)`** sets `multiSelect: true` and is used wherever several answers are valid together: which Design files got Accept updates, which proposed fixes or new tokens to approve, which states a component needs. Each option is one item; more than 4 items -> group them (by type or screen) or ask in batches.
  - **One question per call**, except where a step says the questions belong together (1.5 framework + base, Scenario C low-confidence variables): then up to 4 questions go in one call, each with its own header.
  - **Approvals** are choice questions too: "Approve (Recommended)" / "Request changes" (description: "Tell me what to change; type it in Other"). Confirmations of something the user does in Figma (publish, Accept updates, open a file or plugin) offer "Done" / "Not yet" (or a problem through Other).
  - **Show first, then ask:** summaries, tables, screenshots and audit numbers go in the message before the AskUserQuestion call; the question itself stays one line.
  - **Typed questions stay plain text:** names, links, paths with no default, hex colors, a repo URL, "what is `<variable>` for" when there is no guess. Where the user must put files on disk, always show the full path of each folder in the message (0.3b). If such a question has a sensible default (a default folder, a default font), it becomes a choice with the default first and "Other" for the typed answer.
  - Fallback for tools without AskUserQuestion (Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, Gemini, or a remote chat): a numbered list, recommended option first; the user replies with the number, several numbers for `Ask (multi)`, or free text.
- **Back on every menu (Abdul, 2026-10-05).** Every `Ask (choice)` and `Ask (multi)` in the whole workflow (this router, every `steps/*.md` file, quick mode, the platform Main Skills, the Storybook and study-reference skills, checkpoints, approvals and confirmations; also 1.3 with its Mobile Adaptive option and 1.6) gets a **"Back"** option, so a wrong pick can be undone and the user can move between steps. The skills do not write it in each menu; this rule adds it.
  - **Where:** always the last option, label "Back", description "Return to the previous question: <its short name>". Never on the first question of a flow (0.0 in the intake, the first question of quick mode or of a skill run on its own), where there is nothing to go back to. The one other exception is the 0.6b "Which library?" menu, which shows four libraries and says in the question that "back" is typed in Other.
  - **Option count:** Back counts toward the 4-option limit. A menu that already has 4 options keeps its 3 most likely and moves the rest to "Other" (say so in the question), or splits the question. In `Ask (multi)`, Back is a normal option; if it is ticked, ignore the other ticks and go back.
  - **What Back does:** re-ask the previous question with the earlier answer shown as "(current)" in its description, undo what that answer recorded (`Project_Brief.md`, `status.json`, loaded step files and Main Skills) and continue forward from the new answer, skipping questions whose answers still hold. Pressing Back again goes one more step back, up to the first question. Moving to any earlier step by name is typed in Other ("back to 0.4", "back to the platform").
  - **After Figma or file work:** Back never undoes Figma changes by itself. If the step being left already changed Figma or created files, say in one line what was done and Ask (choice): "Keep it and go back (Recommended)" / "Undo it, then go back" (description: list exactly what will be removed; nothing in a shared DS or an original reference template is ever removed) before going back.
  - Fallback numbered lists end with "Back" as the last number (not on the first question).
- **Progress line (Abdul, 2026-10-05).** Every question shows where the user is. In AskUserQuestion it goes in the question's `header` (max 12 characters); in a typed question or a numbered-list fallback it is the first line of the message.
  - Intake: `Intake <n>/<total>`, counting only the questions this run will really ask (skipped and prefilled ones are left out). When an answer adds or removes questions (Both -> 1.3, a path that skips 0.4-0.6b), recount and show the new total from the next question on.
  - Later phases: the phase name and the step, e.g. `Foundation`, `Checkpoint 1`, `Components 2/5` (groups), `Screens 3/6`, `Storybook`. Quick mode: `Quick task`.
  - Back keeps the count in step: going back from `Intake 5/9` shows `Intake 4/9`.
- Skip a question when the user already answered it (in this conversation, in the project folder's `Project_Brief.md`, or in memory). Say what you reused in one line.
- If the user says "you decide", pick the recommended option, say which, and continue.
- If the user only asks to **change a color** in an existing DS, skip the intake questions: run the Recolor procedure in the platform Main Skill (section 3b) with `tools/recolor.py`.
- **Quick mode (Abdul, 2026-10-01):** if the user runs `/ds-quick`, says "quick mode", or asks for one specific task on a live file (one component, an audit, one fix) and does not want a project set up, skip the intake questions and follow `steps/quick-mode.md`. Preflight (0b) and every rule still apply. If it is unclear, Ask (choice) once: "Quick task on this file" / "Full project setup".
- After the last intake question, post a short **Intake Summary** (section 9) and get a "yes" before any Figma work.
- Record every answer in `[Project folder]\Project_Brief.md` as you go, so a later session never re-asks.
- `[Project folder]` is always `My Projects\<Project>` (plus the platform suffix, section 10). Projects never live in the Root; the Root holds only the workflow (Main Skills, rules, hooks, tools).
- **Changelog (every Figma change):** every session that builds or changes anything in the project's Figma file appends one dated entry to the project's `CHANGELOG.md` (what was added, changed or removed) with `Storybook synced: no`, then runs `python tools/project_status.py "My Projects/<Project>"` to refresh `status.json`. A Storybook update marks the entries synced with `--mark-synced`. The daily check (SessionStart hook) reads only these files, never Figma, and asks the user, per project with unsynced entries, Ask (choice): "Update Storybook now?" "Update now" (description: open the DS file and the Figma plugin first) / "Later" / "Skip this time".
- All paths are relative to the Root. Never write absolute machine paths (like `D:\...`) into skills or briefs.
- Refer to Figma nodes by **name** (pages, component sets, variables, styles). Node IDs are only valid in the file they came from.

## 0b. Step 0 - Tools preflight (runs before any question)

Figma work needs **one** of two tools, plus the Figma Desktop app open. Guide for new users (what each tool does, where to install, Yolo setup and risks, switching): `Figma_Tools/README.md`.
- **FigCli** (figma-cli, https://github.com/silships/figma-cli): a local CLI (`node src/index.js ...` inside its folder). Recommended, and used in **Yolo mode only** (Abdul, 2026-10-04: FigCli runs in Yolo mode only; its Safe-mode plugin was not stable): Figma is patched once to open debugging port 9222, no plugin is needed, Figma can stay minimized, and each command picks its file with `FIGMA_FILE`. Never Safe mode (`connect --safe`, the FigCli plugin) or Browser mode; where patching is not allowed, use the Desktop Bridge.
- **Figma Desktop Bridge** (figma-console-mcp, https://github.com/southleft/figma-console-mcp): MCP tools named `figma_*`, plus the Desktop Bridge plugin running in the file. Used only for what FigCli Yolo cannot do (creating slots with `figma_add_slot_property`) and where patching the Figma app is not allowed (Abdul, 2026-10-05: when both are installed, Yolo is the main tool, including bulk writes, screenshots and audits). A user with only the Desktop Bridge installed does all the work with it; never push them to install or patch for Yolo.

**Yolo rules (every command).**
- Whenever more than one Figma file is open, set `FIGMA_FILE` on **every** FigCli command (Git Bash: `FIGMA_FILE="<name>" node src/index.js ...`; PowerShell: `$env:FIGMA_FILE="<name>"; node src/index.js ...`). Without it the command goes to the **last connected file**, not the file on screen.
- `FIGMA_FILE` matches part of the name: use the exact name from `status.json > figma`, or a part only that file has (an original and its copy: `"Design System -"`, not `"Design System"`). Before the first write to a file in a session, `eval "figma.root.name"` with that `FIGMA_FILE` and write nothing if the name is not the expected one.
- Daemon health: `daemon status` before a batch. "token mismatch" means every command falls back to a slow direct connection (library imports time out at 60 s). Fix with `daemon restart` run with the same `FIGMA_FILE` set.
- The patch (`node src/index.js connect`, admin terminal) and `unpatch` change the Figma app: the user runs them, Claude never does. Claude may run `daemon status` / `daemon restart`, `eval` and the read commands. Say the risks once, when Yolo is first set up on a machine: the Figma app is modified, and port 9222 has no password, so any program on this computer can drive open Figma files while Figma runs patched (local only, not the network). Revert any time with `node src/index.js unpatch`.
- After a Figma update the patch is gone: ask the user to run `node src/index.js connect` again, then `node src/index.js daemon restart`. If the first command after a patch fails, `daemon restart` once before anything else.
- When Figma reopens after the patch, the Desktop Bridge plugin may disconnect; if both tools are in use, ask the user to run it again.

Checks, in order (detect first, ask later):
1. **Installed?** Run `python tools/figma_tools_check.py` (read-only), and search this session for `figma_get_status`. Desktop Bridge counts as installed when the MCP server is configured; FigCli counts when its folder has `node_modules` and `--version` works. The script also says whether port 9222 is open (Figma running patched for Yolo). Say the result in one line.
2. **None installed** -> **stop**. Do not ask intake questions yet. Point to `Figma_Tools/README.md`, explain that at least one tool is needed, and offer to help install in this session. Run a command such as `npm install` inside the tool folder only after the user says yes. The user runs the Yolo patch, adds the MCP server and creates the Figma token themselves (`steps/preflight-install.md`). Recommend FigCli in **Yolo mode**, with its risks in two lines; the Desktop Bridge is the alternative; never Safe or Browser mode. Then Ask (choice): "Tell me when the tools are installed." "Installed, check again" / "Help me install" (description: walk through `Figma_Tools/README.md` step by step).
3. **One installed** -> no tool question. Say in one line which one was found and that you will use it; mention once that the other can be added later (`Figma_Tools/README.md`). Never offer a tool that is not installed.
4. **Both installed** -> the tool is chosen **per file**. Ask question 0.0t right after 0.0 (the project pick), and again for each file that has no tool saved yet, as Ask (choice) (section 0): question "Which Figma tool should I use for '<file name>'?"; option 1 label "FigCli Yolo (Recommended)", description "Stable, no plugin, Figma can stay minimized, about 20-30x fewer tokens; Figma is patched and opens local port 9222"; option 2 label "Figma Desktop Bridge", description "Full build and audit with the Figma skills' MCP tools, nothing patched". If that file's `tool` is saved in `status.json > figma` (`design_system.tool`, or the Design file entry's `tool`; older projects: `figma.tool` as the fallback) and that tool is still installed, skip the question and say in one line which tool you are reusing. Record the answer on that file entry (`figcli` or `desktop-bridge`), and in `figma.tool` as the default for files without one. A saved `figcli` always means Yolo now (older projects ran it in Safe mode).
5. **Connected?** Check the chosen tool before any Figma work:
   - Desktop Bridge: call `figma_get_status` and confirm the bridge is connected (active WebSocket transport).
   - FigCli: `node src/index.js daemon status` in its folder (if it fails, `daemon restart` once), then `FIGMA_FILE="<file name>" node src/index.js eval "figma.root.name"`. No plugin is needed. If port 9222 is closed (the check script says so), Figma is not running patched: ask the user to start Figma, or after a Figma update to run `node src/index.js connect` again as administrator. The file check (section 7c step 3) goes by exact name (and `figma.fileKey` when it returns one).
   - Not connected -> stop and show what to open: for FigCli, Figma Desktop (patched) and `daemon restart`; for the Desktop Bridge, its plugin in Figma Desktop (Plugins > Development > Figma Desktop Bridge).
   - Connected -> say which tool and which file in one line and continue. Remember the name (and key, when available) of the connected file: question 0.2 uses it.
   - **Stale servers:** if `figma_get_status` lists `otherInstances` (other figma-console-mcp servers on ports 9223-9228 from old sessions), tell the user in one line that the Desktop Bridge plugin talks to only one server at a time and can end up connected to an old session. Show the cleanup: close old Claude Code sessions, or end the stale `figma-console-mcp` node processes (Windows: Task Manager > Details > node.exe with `figma-console-mcp` in the command line; macOS/Linux: `pkill -f figma-console-mcp`), then re-run the plugin. Do not kill processes yourself.
   - **Figma token:** the REST-based tools (`figma_get_styles`, `figma_get_file_data`, `figma_check_design_parity`, library reads) need a valid `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`. If one fails with an auth or expired-token error, tell the user in one line to create a new token and update the MCP config (install steps 2-3); plugin-based tools (`figma_execute`, screenshots) keep working meanwhile.

**Tool checkpoints (both tools installed only).** Before a large, time- or token-heavy step (full DS build, full component audit, Brownfield extract, Scenario C variable map, multi-screen builds, a Storybook update from Figma), tell the user in 2-3 lines which tool fits that step better and why, then Ask (choice): "Continue with <current>" / "Switch to <other>", the better fit first with "(Recommended)" and the reason in its description. When only one tool is installed, skip this and keep going.
- FigCli Yolo is the default for everything (Recommended): builds through `eval` with the same `tools/*.figma.js` scripts and the figma-use / figma-generate-library / figma-generate-design rules, full-file extract of tokens and structure, `snapshot` / `rules gen` / `check` regression gates (about 16 s and 300 tokens per file), `verify --measure` of screens (under 1 s and about 500 tokens per frame), quick re-checks after a fix, and cross-file steps (both files reachable at once with `FIGMA_FILE`).
- Desktop Bridge, when installed, is the better fit for: screenshots of every variant in Light and Dark and the final audit-design-system (it scans every variant; FigCli `check` reads strokes, padding and size from one sample variant per set).
- Trial numbers (2026-10-01, ClinicSoft duplicate): FigCli check caught 4 of 5 planted defects (it missed a height change) in about 16 s and 300 tokens; the Desktop Bridge audit caught 5 of 5 in about 52 s and 6-10K tokens. 2026-10-04: the FigCli Safe-mode plugin was not stable, so FigCli runs in Yolo only. The audit-design-system step at the end of every build stays mandatory whichever tool is chosen.
- Mixed setups are fine (for example FigCli Yolo for builds and checks, and the Desktop Bridge for the final audit and variant screenshots).

**Switching any time (Abdul, 2026-10-01).** The user can change tools at any point, on any file, mid-project or days later: they just say so. Nothing in Figma or in the project files belongs to one tool, so a switch never needs rework. On every switch:
1. The user closes the old plugin in that file and opens the new one (Yolo needs no plugin; switching to or from Yolo on a machine means the user runs `connect` or `unpatch`). Re-run check 5 and the file check (section 7c step 3) with the new tool.
2. Save the new tool on that file entry in `status.json` (and `figma.tool`), and log it in that day's `CHANGELOG.md` entry (`Tool switch: <file>: <old> -> <new>`).
3. Load `tools/figma_helpers.figma.js` again in the new tool before scripts that use `DS.*`.
4. **FigCli baseline:** FigCli `check` compares the file with a saved snapshot (`snapshot` + `rules gen`). After any change made through the Desktop Bridge, after a switch, and after each approved checkpoint, regenerate the baseline before trusting the next `check`. Otherwise intended changes show up as drift.
5. Same scripts in both tools: every `tools/*.figma.js` runs in the Desktop Bridge through `figma_execute` and in FigCli through `node src/index.js eval --file <script>` (tested with `check_bindings.figma.js`; in Yolo, with `FIGMA_FILE` set). Screenshots: `figma_capture_screenshot` or `node src/index.js verify "<node id>"`. Writes through FigCli `eval` may be blocked by Claude Code auto mode; the user allows the command or runs it.

**Install only with a yes.** You check and show the steps. Run an install command only after the user agrees, and never `npm install -g`. The user creates the Figma token themselves; never ask them to paste it into the chat. Never run `figma-cli init-agent` in the Root (it writes its own `AGENTS.md`).

Install steps: `Figma_Tools/README.md` (both tools) and `steps/preflight-install.md` (MCP client details).

Also recommended (not blocking): the official Figma MCP and the skills figma-use, figma-generate-library, figma-generate-design, audit-design-system, ui-ux-pro-max. If one is missing, say so in one line and continue.

## 0c. Loading, sessions and token budget (Abdul, 2026-10-01)

Trials ran one session per project (470-650 turns, context up to 690K tokens, re-read on every turn). These rules keep the same quality gates (audits, fidelity, approvals) at a fraction of the cost.

**Load only what the step needs.** This file is the router. The rest of the intake lives in `Design_System_Intake_Skill/steps/` and keeps its section numbers:

| Section | File | Load when |
|---|---|---|
| 0b install steps | `steps/preflight-install.md`, `Figma_Tools/README.md` | preflight finds no tool installed or none connected |
| 1.3-1.5 detail | `steps/both-native.md` | 1.2 = Both |
| 1.6 Mobile Adaptive | `steps/mobile-adaptive.md` | 1.3 = Mobile Adaptive |
| 4 (3a-3d) | `steps/greenfield.md` | 2.1 = Greenfield |
| 5 | `steps/brownfield-1-screens.md` | 2.2 = 1 |
| 6 (Scenario D) | `steps/code-to-design.md` | 2.1 = Code to Design |
| 7 (Scenario C) | `steps/brownfield-3-scenario-c.md` | 2.2 = 3 |
| 7g | `steps/single-file-ds.md` | 2.3 = the DS is inside the Design file |
| 7h | `steps/app-icon.md` | building the ⭐Setup pages, ➜ App Icon missing from a DS file, or the user dropped an app icon |
| 7b | `steps/fix-on-create.md` | a project starts from an existing file; last foundation step of a new build |
| 7c | `steps/figma-files.md` | before the first Figma work of every session |
| 7d, 7e, 7f | `steps/screens.md` | screens are built or changed |
| 10 | `steps/folders.md` | question 0.3, or unsure where a file goes |
| 11, 12 | `steps/finish.md` | end of a build, Storybook step |
| 13 | `steps/quick-mode.md` | `/ds-quick`, or one task on a live file without a project setup (section 0) |

- The platform Main Skill loads after 1.1 / 1.2. The Figma skills (figma-use, figma-generate-library, figma-generate-design, ui-ux-pro-max) load at the first Figma build step of a session, never during the intake questions; load each once per session.
- Read the knowledge base before Figma: names, keys and values come from `data/tokens.json` and `data/component-registry.json`. Re-read Figma only for what the files do not hold, or when `CHANGELOG.md` shows a Figma change after the last export.

**One phase per session.** Phases: Intake (ends at the approved Intake Summary), Foundation, Components (one session per group if the set is large), Screens (one flow, or up to 3 screens, per session), Storybook. At the end of each phase:
1. Write the handoff: `Project_Brief.md` (Status, Checkpoints, one `Next step:` line with what the next session does first), the `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and `python tools/project_status.py "My Projects/<Project>"`.
2. Tell the user in one line: "Phase done. Please start a new session for <next phase>; it resumes from the project files."
3. A resumed session reads only `Project_Brief.md`, `status.json`, the newest `CHANGELOG.md` entries and the step files of its phase. It does not re-read finished phases, re-export variables or re-screenshot approved work, unless the changelog shows work by another tool (then the CLAUDE.md handoff audit runs first).

**Heavy visual work runs in subagents.** Variant screenshots (Light and Dark), side-by-side fidelity captures (section 7f.4) and audits run in the `ds-auditor` agent (screens mode for screens). It saves the images under the project's `audits/` and returns numbers and a list of differences; the main session fixes from that list. The main session opens an image only to show it to the user at a checkpoint. The rules themselves (every variant in each mode, a side-by-side per screen, up to 3 fix rounds, user-only approval) do not change.

**Short Figma scripts.** Paste `tools/figma_helpers.figma.js` into `figma_execute` once per file per session; it keeps `DS.*` helpers loaded (variable binding, Auto Layout frames, text with styles, icons, instances and properties, a raw-value report). Later scripts call them instead of redefining helpers; still one section per script (section 7f.3). If a script says `DS is not defined`, paste the file again.

## 1. Step 0 - Intake basics

First pick the project (always, before 0.1):

| # | Question (send exactly) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0 | Ask (choice): "Which project should I work on?" One option per folder in `My Projects\` (most recently changed first) / "Start a new project". More than 3 projects: the 3 most recent plus "Start a new project"; the user types any other name in "Other". | List the folders in `My Projects\` (skip `_Project_Template` and `README.md`). If there are none, say so and go straight to 0.1. Existing project: read its `Project_Brief.md`, `status.json` and the newest `CHANGELOG.md` entry, then post the **resume line** (Abdul, 2026-10-05): "Last time: <newest changelog entry in one line>. Next step: <the Brief's `Next step:` line>." and Ask (choice): "Continue (Recommended)" (description: <the next step>) / "Something else" (description: type what to do in Other). Continue resumes from the Brief's Status and asks only what is missing. A project with no changelog entry yet says "Intake not finished" and continues from the first unanswered question. If it has unsynced changelog entries, Ask (choice) then: "Update Storybook now" / "Later", to update its Storybook (open the DS file and the Desktop Bridge first). New project: continue with 0.1. |
| 0.0t | Only when both Figma tools are installed (0b check 4) and the file has no saved `tool` (fallback `figma.tool`). Ask (choice): "Which Figma tool should I use for '<file name>'?" Options: "FigCli Yolo (Recommended)" (description: stable, no plugin, Figma can stay minimized, about 20-30x fewer tokens; Figma is patched and opens local port 9222) / "Figma Desktop Bridge" (description: full build and audit with the Figma skills' MCP tools, nothing patched) | Record the `tool` on that file entry in `status.json > figma` and in `figma.tool` (`figcli` / `desktop-bridge`; for a new project, once its folder exists in 0.1 and the files are registered in 0.2). First Yolo pick on a machine: state the risks in two lines (0b, Yolo rules) and point to the setup in `Figma_Tools/README.md`. The user can switch any time (0b, Switching any time). Then run 0b check 5 (connection) with that tool. One tool installed: skip, use it. |

Then ask in this order: **0.1, 0.2, then the platform (Step 1, questions 1.1-1.6), then 0.3, 0.3b, then the path (Step 2, questions 2.1-2.3 / 2.5), then 0.3c, then 0.4-0.8.** The platform comes early because the folder name (section 10) and the default fonts depend on it. The path comes before 0.4-0.8 (Abdul, 2026-10-05) because an existing file or codebase already answers the modes, RTL and fonts, so those are confirmed from the source instead of asked (0.3c).
Until the project folder exists (0.3), keep the answers in the conversation; right after 0.3, write them all into `Project_Brief.md` (copied from the template) and keep it updated from then on.

| # | Question (send exactly) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | "What is the project name?" | Used for folder and Figma file names. Keep the user's spelling; replace spaces with `_` only in folder names. |
| 0.2 | If preflight saw a connected file, first Ask (choice): "Figma is connected to '<file name>'. Is this the Design System file for <Project>?" "Yes, it is the DS file" / "No, a scratch file". Then, typed (next message): "Please share any other Figma links for this project: every Design file with screens (give each a name, e.g. Web App, Admin Dashboard), or 'none'." Otherwise, typed: "Please share the Figma links for this project: the Design System file (one) and every Design file with screens (give each a name, e.g. Web App, Admin Dashboard). Reply 'none' if there are none yet." | Record them in `status.json > figma` (section 7c): one `design_system` and a `design_files` list with name, URL and file key (the part after `/design/` or `/file/`). A connected file the user confirms is registered as the `design_system` (its key from `figma_get_status`; ask for its link). Asked once; later sessions read `status.json`. |

**Now ask Step 1 (platform, section 2), then continue here:**

| # | Question (send exactly) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0.3 | Ask (choice): "Where should the project folder go?" "My Projects\<Project folder> (Recommended)"; another path is typed in "Other". `<Project folder>` already carries the platform suffix (section 10), e.g. `My Projects\ClinicSoft` (Web), `My Projects\ClinicSoft_iOS`. | Store the answer **relative to the Root** (e.g. `My Projects/ClinicSoft/`), even when the user replies with a full machine path; never write the absolute path (a hook blocks it). Create the folder by copying `My Projects\_Project_Template\` (never edit the template itself), replace `<Project>` in its files, then write every answer so far into `Project_Brief.md`. |
| 0.3b | Right after the folder exists, send this message **exactly** (never shorten it to "I set up subfolders"), with `<full path>` replaced by the real full path of the project folder on this machine, the Root path plus `My Projects\<Project folder>` (shown in the chat only; files still store relative paths):<br>"Your project folder is ready. Put any files you have for this project in these folders:<br>- `<full path>\Inputs\Brand\`: logo, brand book, brand colors, fonts<br>- `<full path>\Inputs\Inspiration\`: reference designs, competitor apps, screenshots or links you like<br>- `<full path>\Inputs\Screens\`: screenshots of the existing product, if there is one<br>- `<full path>\Inputs\Research\`: research, personas, PRDs, any notes about the product<br>Copy the files there in File Explorer (or Finder), then pick an option below."<br>Then Ask (choice): "Files go in `<full path>\Inputs\`. Do you have files for this project?" "I added files, read them" (description: I read every file before the next question) / "Don't have inputs" (description: continue without files; I ask the questions the files would have answered) / "I will add them later" (description: I remind you before colors and direction are decided) | Read every file in `Inputs/` (list them in one line with counts) and use them: Brand for colors and fonts (3b, 0.6), Inspiration and Research for the direction (3c), Screens for Brownfield. Record the counts in `Project_Brief.md > Inputs`. "Later": before 3b / 3c (or the Brownfield extract), check `Inputs/` again and, if still empty, Ask (choice) once more: "Files added, read them" / "Continue without files". Skip 0.3b for an existing project that already has files in `Inputs/`. |
| 0.3c | **Prefill from the inputs and the path (Abdul, 2026-10-05), no question of its own.** Runs after the path (2.1-2.3 / 2.5) is known. **Greenfield with files in `Inputs/`:** read them and prefill what they answer: 0.4 (a brand book or inspiration that is dark-first or shows both themes), 0.5 (Arabic text or an RTL product in Brand or Research), 0.6 (the font named in the brand book or brand files), and the brand color for 3.3, and 0.6b (an icon library named in the brand book). Post the found answers as a short list, each with the file it came from, then Ask (choice): "Use these answers?" "Use these (Recommended)" / "Change something" (description: I ask those questions one by one). Questions the files do not answer are asked as usual. **Brownfield and Code to Design:** 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.6b are not asked in the intake. They are read from the source at the path's first read step (Brownfield type 1 extract, Scenario C Variable Map, Scenario D code read: modes from the variable modes or `:root` / `.dark`, RTL from Arabic content or `dir="rtl"`, fonts from text styles or the font setup, icons from the file's icon components or the icon package in the code) and confirmed there in one Ask (choice): "Use these (Recommended)" / "Change something". The Intake Summary shows them as `from <file / code>, confirmed at <step>`. Greenfield with no files: ask 0.4-0.6 as usual. | Record each prefilled answer in `Project_Brief.md` with its source. A prefilled answer is still the user's answer only after "Use these". |
| 0.4 | Ask (choice): "Which color modes do you need?" "Light and Dark (Recommended)" / "Light only" / "Dark only" | Sets Semantic modes. One mode only (Light only, Dark only): follow "Single-mode systems" in the platform Main Skill. |
| 0.5 | Ask (choice): "Do you need Arabic / RTL support?" "No" / "Yes" (nothing marked recommended; put first the answer the inputs point to) | If Yes: mirrored layouts, RTL auto layout checks, directional icons (arrows, chevrons, back) get mirrored variants, Arabic font pairing, and text styles tested with Arabic copy. |
| 0.6 | Ask (choice): "Which fonts should the system use?" "<platform default> (Recommended)" (description: the Latin default, plus the Arabic default when 0.5 = Yes) / "The brand font" (description: type its name, and the Arabic font if RTL is needed, in Other). | Say the one default for the chosen platform in the question: Web = Poppins (org default) or the brand font; iOS = SF Pro; Android = Roboto / Roboto Flex. Arabic default pairing: IBM Plex Sans Arabic (Web/Android), SF Arabic (iOS). Confirm the fonts are installed / available in Figma (a read-only `figma_execute` of `figma.listAvailableFontsAsync()` is fine). |
| 0.6b | **Icons (Abdul, 2026-10-06).** Ask (choice): "Which icon library should the system use?" "<platform default> (Recommended)" (description: Lucide for Web, SF Symbols style for iOS, Material Symbols for Android) / "Already in the Figma project" (description: reuse the icon components in the DS file or a linked library) / "Another free library" (description: Phosphor, Tabler, Heroicons or Remix Icon, picked next). When 0.2 or the path already showed a file or library with icon components (Brownfield, Code to Design existing DS, a 3.1 DS or reference template), "Already in the Figma project" goes first and is the recommended one. The platform default for Cross-platform follows its base (Material 3 or Custom -> Material Symbols, Apple HIG -> SF Symbols style); Mobile Adaptive's default is its two glyph layers per icon, SF Symbols style on iOS and Material Symbols on Android (`steps/mobile-adaptive.md`); another library gives both platforms one shared glyph. "Another free library" -> Ask (choice): "Which library? To go back, type back in Other." "Phosphor" (description: rounded, friendly, Regular + Fill weights) / "Tabler" (description: the largest set, outline, close to Lucide) / "Heroicons" (description: small set by the Tailwind team, outline + solid) / "Remix Icon" (description: line + fill pairs; not for logos or app icons). **No Back option on this menu (Abdul, 2026-10-06):** all four libraries are shown as options instead; "back" typed in Other returns to 0.6b, and any other library name typed there is used after the license check below. | Library details, licenses and fetch ids: `tools/icon_libraries.json` (all free, SVG, commercial use allowed; the workflow fetches the SVGs and builds the Icon component set itself, the user does nothing). Record in `Project_Brief.md` (0.6b) and `status.json > icons` = `{"library": "<id or existing>", "source": "<file or library name, existing only>", "style": "<weight / outline-fill>"}`. **Already in the Figma project:** at the first Foundation step, read the DS file and its enabled libraries for icon components (an Icons page, `Icon/*` or `icon/*` names, a set of same-size vector components) and report the count, names and style; reuse them as they are (Fix on create adds the swap property, the icon token binding and real names where missing). Icons a component needs that the set lacks are drawn in the same style or taken from the closest library in `icon_libraries.json` and logged in `CHANGELOG.md`. If no icon components are found, say so and re-ask 0.6b without that option. A typed library that is not in the file: check its license allows commercial use before using it; if it does not, say so and re-ask. A reference template or existing DS whose set differs from the picked library: replace each icon's vector inside its existing component (names kept), so every instance updates. Brownfield and Code to Design prefill it at 0.3c from the source (icon components in the file, or the icon package the code imports, e.g. `lucide-react`). |
| 0.7 | Ask (choice): "Do you also want a live Storybook for developers?" "Yes, after components (Recommended)" (description: browse components, try variants and properties, read use cases, link back to Figma; recommended when developers will use the DS) / "Later" / "No" | Optional. Yes -> run section 12 after the Components checkpoint. Default stack for every platform: React + Storybook. iOS and Android projects get a web Storybook (React + CSS) styled like the native components. Record the answer in `Project_Brief.md` and in `status.json > storybook_plan` (`yes`, `later`, `no`). **Later** always gets a trigger in `status.json > storybook_ask_at` (default `components-approved`; after a second "Later", `screens-approved`; after a third, `next-session`). Ask again when that point is reached; the SessionStart hook lists projects whose plan is `later`. |
| 0.8 | Ask (choice): "Do you also want example screens built from the design system?" "Yes, after components (Recommended)" (description: e.g. login, list, detail, in a separate Design file) / "No, design system only" | Yes -> the Screens phase and checkpoint 3 run. Screens are built in a separate Design file (`<Project>`) that uses the published DS library, so the user will be asked to publish the library at the Components checkpoint (section 8). Skip for Brownfield and Code to Design paths that already rebuild screens. |

## 2. Step 1 - Platform (asked right after 0.2)

| # | Question | Next |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Ask (choice): "Which platform is this design system for?" "Web" / "Mobile" | Web -> load `Web_Design_System_Skill`. Mobile -> 1.2 |
| 1.2 | Ask (choice): "Which mobile platform?" "iOS" / "Android" / "Both" | iOS -> `iOS_Design_System_Skill`. Android -> `Android_Design_System_Skill`. Both -> 1.3 |
| 1.3 | Ask (choice): "Native, cross-platform or Mobile Adaptive?" "Native" (description: two DS files, iOS and Android, each app looks native) / "Cross-platform" (description: Flutter, React Native: one DS, one shared look) / "Mobile Adaptive (Native, one file)" (description: one DS file; the OS mode keeps each platform native, optional EN/AR) | Native -> 1.4. Cross-platform -> 1.5. Mobile Adaptive -> 1.6. See "Both: native or cross-platform" below. |
| 1.4 | Native only. Ask (choice): "Do you want a shared Brand Foundation file that both systems copy from?" "Yes (Recommended)" (description: brand Primitives only: color ramps, font families, raw values; recommended when one brand drives both apps) / "No" | Yes -> create `<Project> Brand Foundation` (Primitives only). Then load **both** `iOS_Design_System_Skill` and `Android_Design_System_Skill`, two independent systems. |
| 1.5 | Cross-platform only. Two questions in one AskUserQuestion call: Ask (choice) "Which framework?" "Flutter" / "React Native"; Ask (choice) "Which base should the shared design follow?" "Material 3 (Recommended)" (description: best for one codebase) / "Apple HIG" / "Custom brand UI" (description: custom look on a Material 3 structure) | Load the matching Main Skill as the base (Material 3 or custom -> `Android_Design_System_Skill`; Apple HIG -> `iOS_Design_System_Skill`). One DS, one Design file, folder `<Project>_Mobile\`. |

| 1.6 | Mobile Adaptive only. Ask (choice): "Which languages?" "English only" / "English + Arabic (RTL)" | Load `steps/mobile-adaptive.md` and **both** `iOS_Design_System_Skill` and `Android_Design_System_Skill` as platform references. One DS file, folder `<Project>_Mobile\`. |

Both: native vs cross-platform rules (DS files, Brand Foundation, Design files, folders, `status.json` fields): `steps/both-native.md`. Mobile Adaptive (Native, one file: collections, platform/direction techniques, Figma limits): `steps/mobile-adaptive.md`.

Platform rules (never mix):
- **Web** = Tailwind conventions, web breakpoints (Desktop 1440 / iPad 768 / Mobile 375), Hover / Focus / Active states, Lucide icons by default (intake 0.6b).
- **iOS** = Apple HIG, Dynamic Type, iOS semantic names (System Background, Label...), SF Symbols style icons by default (intake 0.6b), pt units.
- **Android** = Material Design 3, `md.sys.color` tokens, state layers, elevation levels, Material Symbols by default (intake 0.6b), dp units.
- Each platform is **independent**: its own Figma DS file, its own variables, its own skills folder. Nothing is shared or merged between Web, iOS and Android. "Both" + Native means two full systems (the optional Brand Foundation only supplies Primitive values to copy); "Both" + Cross-platform means one shared system. "Both" + Mobile Adaptive (Native, one file) is the one exception where iOS and Android share a DS file: platform differences live only in OS-mode variables (`steps/mobile-adaptive.md`).
- After choosing, load the platform Main Skill. Its required skills (figma-use + figma-generate-library; figma-swiftui for iOS; figma-code-connect when mapping to code) load at the first Figma build step of the session (section 0c), not during the intake questions. Until the iOS / Android Main Skills are finished, tell the user and use what exists in them.

---

## 3. Step 2 - Greenfield or Brownfield

| # | Question | Next |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Ask (choice): "Is this a new product, or does something already exist?" "Greenfield" (description: new product, nothing designed yet) / "Brownfield" (description: screens or a design system already exist in Figma) / "Code to Design" (description: a coded app, e.g. a GitHub repo, is the source; its screens are built in Figma from an existing or a new DS) | Greenfield -> section 4. Brownfield -> 2.2. Code to Design -> section 6 (Scenario D, `steps/code-to-design.md`), which asks 2.5 (existing DS or new DS from the code) |
| 2.2 | Ask (choice): "What already exists?" "Screens, no design system" (description: 1, screens in Figma or screenshots) / "Imperfect DS + screens" (description: 3, a design system exists, possibly imperfect, and the screens follow it only partly or not at all) | 1 -> section 5. 3 -> 2.3. (Type 2, live code with no Figma, is now Scenario D branch b.) |
| 2.3 | Ask (choice): "Where does the design system live?" "In its own library file" (description: a separate DS file that the Design files enable as a library) / "Inside the Design file" (description: variables, styles and components sit on pages next to the screens, no library) (nothing marked recommended; put first the answer the files point to) | Library file -> section 7. Inside the Design file -> section 7 with section 7g (`steps/single-file-ds.md`), which asks the path (2.4: split into a library, or keep one file) after the Variable Map |

### Decision tree

```
Tools preflight (0b) -> which tools are installed? None -> stop, Figma_Tools/README.md; both -> tool question 0.0t after 0.0; then connected? No -> stop
Intake basics 0.0-0.2 (existing project: resume line, Continue / Something else) -> Platform (1.1-1.6) -> load platform Main Skill(s) -> folder + Inputs 0.3-0.3b -> path 2.1 (below) -> prefill 0.3c -> 0.4-0.8 (Greenfield: only what the files did not answer; Brownfield / Code to Design: 0.4-0.6b confirmed from the source later)
   └─ Greenfield or Brownfield? (2.1)
      ├─ Greenfield
      │  ├─ Existing AI-ready DS (Figma DS + .md skills)? (3.1)
      │  │  ├─ Yes -> read files -> quick audit -> fix gaps -> work from it
      │  │  ├─ Start from a reference template (3.2) -> pick an entry from references.json -> user duplicates it -> rebrand -> fix known gaps
      │  │  └─ No
      │  │     ├─ Brand folder has files? -> derive Primitives/Semantics
      │  │     │  └─ empty -> ask brand color (3.3)
      │  │     ├─ Inspiration folder has files? -> set design direction
      │  │     │  └─ empty -> ask industry (3.4) -> derive style
      │  │     └─ Build per platform Main Skill build order
      ├─ Code to Design (Scenario D) -> repo/path -> read code (tokens, routes, popups, states) -> which DS? (2.5)
      │  ├─ a. Existing DS -> links -> editable DS page (2.6), other pages read only -> study DS -> token map code->DS -> gap table + specs -> missing components on the editable page only -> publish (ask) -> screens in the Design file -> audit; manual edits kept
      │  └─ b. New DS from the code -> merge summary -> "<Project>" + "<Project> Design System" files -> Primitives + Semantics + components (build order) -> publish -> screens per module -> audit
      └─ Brownfield (2.2)
         ├─ Type 1: screens, no DS  -> register the Design file as the source -> open it -> extract (frames or screenshots) -> merge approval -> "<Project> Design System" file -> build -> publish -> link the Design file to the library -> rebuild screens
         └─ Type 3: imperfect DS + Design file -> where is the DS? (2.3)
            ├─ Own library file -> Scenario C: Variable Map -> fix DS + publish -> audit screens -> approve report -> fix screens -> log + Accept updates
            └─ Inside the Design file (7g) -> version -> DS pages -> Variable Map -> path? (2.4)
               ├─ Split into a library (recommended) -> publish this file -> screens move to a new Design file -> audit -> Scenario C from step 2
               └─ Keep one file -> Scenario C with history versions instead of publish / Accept updates
Every path from an existing file: Fix on create (section 7b), except a shared DS in Scenario D branch a (read only; issues are reported, not fixed)
Every path: linked Figma files, publish and file check (section 7c)
Every path: checkpoints Foundation -> Components -> Screens (section 8)
Every path ends: write project skills + final audit (section 11)
Optional (0.8 = Yes): screens in a Design file after the Components checkpoint (publish first, section 8)
Optional (0.7 = Yes): Storybook after the Components checkpoint (section 12)
```

---

## 4-7f. Path steps and shared rules

Sections 4 (Greenfield), 5 and 7 (Brownfield types 1 and 3), 6 (Scenario D, Code to Design), 7b (Fix on create), 7c (linked Figma files), 7d-7f (screens) live in `steps/` (map in section 0c). Load the file of the chosen path, plus the shared files it names.

---

## 8. Step 7 - Approval checkpoints (every path)

Stop and ask for approval at each checkpoint. Show screenshots of each mode the project has (Light and Dark, or the single mode) and a short summary, never just a statement.

**One to-do list per checkpoint (Abdul, 2026-10-05).** Everything the user has to do in Figma at a checkpoint (rename a file, publish the library, enable it in a Design file, Accept updates in each named Design file, save a version) goes in **one numbered to-do list** at the end of the checkpoint message, in the order to do them. After the approval answer, one Ask (choice): "Is the to-do list done?" "All done (Recommended)" / "Some are done" (then one Ask (multi) with one option per item) / "Not yet". This replaces the separate rename, publish and Accept updates questions at that point; it records the same fields (`design_system.last_publish`, each Design file's `library_updates_accepted`) and the same checks run afterwards (section 7c). Items still open are listed again at the start of the next session. The same bundling applies outside checkpoints whenever two or more user actions in Figma come together (for example publish + Accept updates after new components in a screens flow).

| Checkpoint | Show | Question |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Foundation** | Colors (Primitives + Semantics, per mode), typography scale, spacing, radius, shadows, icons, the ➜ App Icon page (drop zones, or the presented icon, section 7h), contrast results, Fix on create before/after, **user to-do list** (e.g. rename the Figma file to '<Project> Design System', which a plugin cannot do; drop the app icon into ➜ App Icon while it is still waiting) | Ask (choice): "Foundation is ready. Approve it?" "Approve, go to components (Recommended)" / "Request changes" |
| **2. Components** | Every component set per group, all variants and states, per-mode previews; anything left out and why (e.g. Avatar Photo when no photo was supplied) | Ask (choice): "Components are ready. Approve them?" "Approve (Recommended)" (description: screens or Storybook come next when planned) / "Request changes". If screens will follow (0.8 = Yes) or Storybook is due, the to-do list holds "Publish '<Project> Design System' as a library (Assets > Library > Publish)" and "Enable it in the Design file" (screens go in a separate Design file that must enable this library), then the to-do question above. Save `design_system.last_publish` in `status.json` when confirmed. Single-file projects (`figma.layout` = `single-file`, section 7g) skip the publish question and save a Figma version instead. |
| **3. Screens** | Every rebuilt or new screen next to its source (screen spec and side-by-side captures, section 7f), per mode, and the Design file audit result with the fidelity checks (section 7d) | Ask (choice): "Screens are ready. Approve them?" "Approve (Recommended)" / "Request changes" |

- Do not start the next phase before the user approves the current one.
- Only the user's reply approves a checkpoint. An agent (any tool) writes `Ready for review` in `Project_Brief.md > Checkpoints` and never `Approved`, `Passed` or `Completed` on its own.
- Save a Figma version in history after each approved checkpoint.
- Paths with no screens (0.8 = No) use checkpoints 1 and 2 only; if the user asks for screens later, ask 0.8's publish step first.
- **Avatar Photo** and any other image content: there is no approved image asset in the Root. At the Components step Ask (choice) once: "Avatar Photo needs a sample photo you are allowed to use." "Initials and Icon only for now (Recommended)" / "I will share a photo". Never pull random photos from the web.

---

## 9. Intake Summary (post before any Figma work)

One approval covers the whole plan, including the design direction (3.4 is not approved separately). Post the block, with at most one line of notes, then Ask (choice):

"Before I touch Figma, please confirm this plan." "Yes, start (Recommended)" / "Change something" (description: type the change in Other)

```
Project: <name>            Local folder: <path>
Figma: <links and roles>
Platform: <Web / iOS / Android / Both native (+ Brand Foundation yes/no) / Both cross-platform (Flutter / RN, base) / Both Mobile Adaptive (EN or EN+AR)> -> Main Skill(s): <names>
Modes: <Light / Dark>      RTL: <Yes/No>      Fonts: <Latin / Arabic>   (each: asked / from Inputs / from <file or code>, confirmed at <step>)
Icons: <library (license)> / existing set in <file or library>   (asked / from <file or code>)
Path: <Greenfield 3a/3b-3d | Brownfield type 1/3 | Code to Design a (existing DS, editable page: <name>) / b (new DS)>
Inputs found: Brand <n files / empty>, Inspiration <n / empty>, Screens <n / link>, Research <n / empty>
Direction: <style, corner/density/elevation, brand contrast result and fix>
Screens: <Yes after components (Design file, needs published library) / No>
Storybook: <Yes after components / Later (ask at: <trigger>) / No>
Next step: <first action>
```

## 10-12. Folder conventions, finish, Storybook

Section 10 (folder conventions): `steps/folders.md`. Sections 11 (always finish with skills and the final audit) and 12 (optional live Storybook): `steps/finish.md`.
